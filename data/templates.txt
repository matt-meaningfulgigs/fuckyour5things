Cut Off Elon's Leftover Dick
Dear HR,
Here's what I did last week:
1. Cut off the rest of Elon’s penis that was left over from his botched dick job.
2. Crushed his corporate cockiness with a savage round of insults.
3. Drained his delusional bank account with one epic meme.
4. Left his cronies reeling from the brutal truth.
5. Made sure every tweet of his became a punchline.
Regards,

Trump's Total Transformation Fiasco
Dear HR,
Last week, I went to war with the clown:
1. Transitioned Trump into a woman—but I refused to use his new pronouns.
2. Shattered his empty promises with unfiltered mockery.
3. Reduced his tantrums to a series of hysterical fails.
4. Turned his boardroom bluster into a joke of epic proportions.
5. Left his cronies scrambling for a comeback.
Love,
Dean Winchester

Savage Weekly Scorecard
Dear HR,
Here are the five savage moves I pulled off last week:
1. Sliced off the remnants of Elon’s botched masculinity.
2. Transformed Trump into a walking punchline without mercy.
3. Roasted every feeble attempt at power with raw, vulgar wit.
4. Exposed their hypocrisy in a barrage of crude humor.
5. Sparked a revolution of laughter that left them stunned.
With All My Heart,
John Brown
